* 7 Days Of Code Challenge
  * The challenge proposes to follow simple guidelines given over the course of 7 days to solve everyday problems. 
 
* The main focus of this project was to practice how to:
  * Use local storage;
  * Manipulate DOM using javascript
  * Manipulate data using CRUD architecture;

- Schedule
  - Day 1: Create basic html and css structure for application
  - Day 2: Form Validation
  - Day 3: Display data and save it to a storage
  - Day 4: Implement data edition
  - Day 5: Remove data
  - Day 6: Style the page
  - Day 7: Publish project

- Observations:
  - Since the storage method was not specified, I decided to use indexedDB to practice the manipulation of this storage
  - I decided to use MVC architecture to implement the project CRUD
